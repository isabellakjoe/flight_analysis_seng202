Thank you for choosing Hop2it!
-------------------------------------------- How to use the Program --------------------------------------------
To use our program, simply load in data using the "Add" menu at the top left corner of the program and choose the type
of data file you wish to add.
Once added, the data will be displayed in either one of the three tables if Add Route, Airline or Airport was chosen,
otherwise the Fight Pane with be displayed showing added flight data.
The data can be filtered using the Filter dropdown boxes at the top right of the tables, and will filter data based
on the selected parameter.
Once loaded, the objects in the data tables can be double clicked to display a more detailed pane on that object.
Inside this detailed pane, you can choose to edit an existing Object by clicking the Edit button, which will
allow editing.
Edits can be saved Using Save, or discard using Cancel. The Back button will return you to the data tables.
Additionally, if you hold CTRL and left click two Airport objects, you can choose to get the distance between those
two Airports.
On the left hand side of the program is a search pane, with three tabs for Route, Airline and Airport searches.
Here you can input search parameters for the different tables, and an Advanced Pane with more search options is
available by clicking the Advanced button. Searching begins once Search is clicked, and Reset will reset the tables
and the search inputs.
Below the Search and Reset buttons is Add New Route/Airport/Airline, (Depending on which tab you are in) which allows
for adding a single object to the table. Filling out the fields and clicking save will add the created object to
its corresponding table.
