Open terminal and navigate to the directory the executable Jar is located.

downloaded Jar.

*How to use the Program:*
-----------------------
-----------------------

*Loading Data:*
-------------
To use our program, simply load in data using the "Load" menu at the top left
corner of the program and choose the type of data file you wish to add.
Once added, the data will be displayed in either one of the three tables if
Add Route, Airline or Airport was chosen, otherwise the Fight Pane with be
displayed showing added flight data. If the file contains an object that already
exists in the table, the entire file will not be added.
*Filtering, Detailed Data and Editing:*
---------
The data can be filtered using the Filter dropdown boxes at the top right of
the tables, and will filter data based on the selected parameter.
Once loaded, the objects in the data tables can be double clicked to display a
more detailed pane on that object.
Inside this detailed pane, you can choose to edit an existing Object by
clicking the Edit button, which will allow editing. Currently there is no way
to delete an entry from a table, only edit one.
Edits can be saved Using Save, or discard using Cancel. The Back button will
return you to the data tables. Additionally, if you hold CTRL and left click
two Airport objects, you can choose to get the distance between those two
Airports.
*Searching:*
----------
On the left hand side of the program is a search pane, with three tabs for
Route, Airline and Airport searches.
Here you can input search parameters for the different tables, and an Advanced
Pane with more search options is available by clicking the Advanced button.
Searching begins once Search is clicked, and Reset will reset the tables and
the search inputs. If nothing satisfies the search parameters, no data will be
displayed in the table. Also, if spelling is incorrect, the desired data will
not be displayed until the spelling is corrected.
*Adding Individual Airlines/Airports/Routes:*
--------------------------------------------
Below the Search and Reset buttons is Add New Route/Airport/Airline,
(Depending on which tab you are in) which allows for adding a single object to
the table. Filling out the fields and clicking save will add the created object
to its corresponding table.
*Map View:*
---------------
Upon navigating to the map tab at the top of the screen, a map of the world is
shown, with a quick display pane at the top right hand corner.  The quick 
display pane can be used to display all loaded airports and routes found in the
table view, search for and display routes using a particular  equipment or 
departing a specific airport. Additionally, a loaded flight can be displayed on
the map. All routes, all airports and the flight can be quickly removed using 
the clear buttons located at the bottom of the pane.
*Graph View:*
------------------
The graph view tab contains graphical information for the data. If no graphs
have been requested, the graph view will prompt the user to analyse all loaded
data. Upon doing so the different graphs can be shown by selecting them from the
dropdown box. To show a graph of specific data, navigate to the data view, 
select all the data you wish to graph using ctrl+click. Then right-click and 
select the graphing option you wish to use.
